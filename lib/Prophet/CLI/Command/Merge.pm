=head2 _do_merge $source $target

Merges changesets from the source replica into the target replica.

Fails fatally if the source and target are the same, or the target is
not writable.

Conflicts are resolved by either the resolver specified in the
C<PROPHET_RESOLVER> environmental variable, the C<prefer> argument
(can be set to C<to> or C<from>, in which case Prophet will
always prefer changesets from one replica or the other), or by
using a default resolver.

Returns the number of changesets merged.
