=head2 attempt_automatic_conflict_resolution

Given a L<Prophet::Conflict> which can not be cleanly applied to a
replica, it is sometimes possible to automatically determine a sane
resolution to the conflict.

=over

=item When the new-state of the conflicting change matches the
previous head of the replica.

=item When someone else has previously done the resolution and we
have a copy of that hanging aroun

** This bit seems hard

=back


In those cases, this routine will generate a L<Prophet::ChangeSet> which resolves 
as many conflicts as possible.

It will then update $self->conflicting_changes to mark which
L<Prophet::ConflictingChange>s and L<Prophet::ConflictingPropChanges>
have been automatically resolved.
